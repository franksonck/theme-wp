# Theme Wordpress

This is a Wordpress theme used on most of JLM 2017 websites. It is based on [Sage](https://roots.io/sage/). Please read Sage documentation to understand how to build and use this theme.

This theme depends on [JLM 2017 Wordpress Plugin](https://github.com/jlm2017/wp-plugin). The plugin must be installed for the theme to work correctly.
